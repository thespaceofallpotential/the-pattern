# the pattern
> a curious pattern

A curious correspondence between the evolution of form/ complexity, analogical thinking, and several other otherwise unrelated concepts.

For example:-

1. what is general between *(arbitrarily any)* two universal phenomena is a subset of both

2. if we approach the unification of *(all domains of)* knowldege by deduplicative-reformation *(set-theoretic intersection)*, like refactoring legacy software-code around a well-formed core, the result will be a radically simplified understanding of the universe

3. in nature, no x exists alone: {x: territory, and map} -- all well-formed reference/ ontological frames are relative, therefore *(like territory)* composed and composable

4. ...
